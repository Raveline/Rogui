High priority:

[X] Add flippable / rotable glyph
[ ] Add support for mouse events on tilegrid and entity grid
[ ] Ability to add an alpha overlay (to handle things like FOV, lighting effects)

Medium priority:

[ ] Add customisable default handlers for components to override keys
[ ] Add vertical line DSL instruction
[ ] Particle utility, whatever form it might have...
[ ] Add a more involved executable with a very basic game
[ ] Generate haddock documentation and see what needs documentation

Low priority:

[ ] Add multiline text component
[ ] Ensure LogConsole doesn't display excessive content (beyond visible height)
[ ] Batching draw call could be an improvement, I'm not sure it's doable but interesting to investigate.
[ ] Add a more comprehensive test suite
[ ] Add FPS overlay
