High priority:

[ ] Generate haddock documentation and see what needs documentation

Medium priority:

[ ] Ability to add an alpha overlay (to handle things like FOV, lighting effects)
[ ] Particle utility, whatever form it might have...
[ ] Add a more involved executable with a very basic game

Low priority:

[ ] Ensure LogConsole doesn't display excessive content (beyond visible height)
[ ] Batching draw call could be an improvement, I'm not sure it's doable but interesting to investigate.
[ ] Add a more comprehensive test suite
