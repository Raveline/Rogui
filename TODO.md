High priority:

[ ] Generate haddock documentation and see what needs documentation

Medium priority:

[ ] Add error handling in boot and loadBrush
[ ] Particle utility, whatever form it might have...

Low priority:

[ ] Ensure LogConsole doesn't display excessive content (beyond visible height)
[ ] Batching draw call could be an improvement, I'm not sure it's doable but interesting to investigate.
[ ] Add a more comprehensive test suite
[ ] Add a more involved executable with a very basic game
[ ] Add logging to report errors / mistakes
