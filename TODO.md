High priority:

[ ] Add customisable default handlers for components to override keys. This has become even more urgent: see ButtonDemo.hs, it makes no sense to have to use up / down arrow keys here.
[ ] Add multiline text component

Medium priority:

[ ] Particle utility, whatever form it might have...
[ ] Analyze parts that are still in need of documentation
[ ] Add a basic modal helper
[ ] Some tooltip / hovering helper ?
[ ] Add a "Getting stated" documentation

Low priority:

[ ] Support fullscreen
[ ] Add a more comprehensive test suite
[ ] Add FPS overlay
[ ] Have some benchmarking suite to be able to experiment with performance improvement (grouping draw calls with similar colour, e.g. - or even simply avoiding some SDL calls that are redundant)
[ ] Add an intermediary demo illustrating component composition
[ ] Add watering animation by alpha change in rogueharvest
