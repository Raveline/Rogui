High priority:

[ ] Add vertical line DSL instruction

[ ] Batching draw call could be an improvement, I'm not sure it's doable but interesting to investigate.

[ ] Particle utility, whatever form it might have...
[ ] Add a more involved executable with a very basic game
[ ] Generate haddock documentation and see what needs documentation
